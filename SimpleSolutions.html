                        Green energy comes in many shapes and sizes, and it can be difficuly to figure out what would be the best for your home. That's why we provided a list of 
                        energy sources that can be used in your home:<br><br>

                        <u>Geothermal Heat Pumps</u> <br><br>

                        A geothermal heat pump, also known as a ground source heat pump or water source heat pump, 
                        transfers heat from the home to the ground using the ground as a heat source and as a heat 
                        sink. The efficiency of geothermal heat pumps is two to three times that of commonly used air 
                        Source Heat Pumps (ASHPs). This is because geothermal heat pumps rely on constant ground temperatures 
                        to transport heat to or from your home. In most of the U.S., the top 10 feet of the earth remain between 
                        5°F to 75°F and often only 50°F to 60°F. On the other hand, air temperatures can fluctuate from 0°F to more 
                        than 100°F over the course of the year. Geothermal heat pumps are durable and long-lasting. In some 
                        cases, specially equipped systems can provide hot water even during the hottest months of the year. 
                        Although the purchase and installation costs are higher than for an ASHP system of similar capacity,
                         these additional costs can be recovered through energy savings over 10 to 15 years. <br><br>
                        
                        <u>Solar Water Heating</u> <br><br>
                        
                        A solar water heater uses sunlight to heat your home's water supply. A solar water heating system uses insulated 
                        storage tanks or solar collectors to collect and store the sun's heat and heat the circulating water. A solar water 
                        heater needs a backup system like a conventional water heater when there is not enough sunlight. <br><br>
                        
                        <u>Solar Energy Systems </u><br><br>
                        
                        PV systems capture sunlight and convert it into electricity. Depending on how many solar panels are used, solar energy 
                        can meet all or part of your home's electricity needs. It can also heat water. With enough sunlight, solar PV systems 
                        can produce energy in hot or cold climates. The solar cell is the foundation of a solar PV system. Several solar cells
                        make up a module called a solar panel. Solar panels can produce up to 400 watts of power. Solar panels are designed to
                        withstand storm and hail impacts. They are also resistant to UV damage. They are exceptionally reliable and require
                        extraordinarily little maintenance. Panels are usually placed on a building's rooftop or in a rack on the ground to 
                        form a solar array. They can be mounted on a fixed angle, or they can be tracked by a device that tracks the sun's
                        rays to maximize solar capture. <br><br>
                    
                        <u>Wind Energy Systems</u><br><br>
                        
                        Small residential wind systems can provide all or part of your home's electrical needs (if there is enough land and average
                        wind speeds). They can be connected to solar and battery storage for emergency back-up power. Wind turbines convert the 
                        wind into electricity by turning a shaft connected to a generator. The size and speed of the turbine determine the amount
                        of electricity it will generate. Typical residential wind systems have power ratings of 5-30 kilowatts. A homeowner needs 
                        at least 1 acre (about half the area of a Manhattan city block) of land and an area with an average yearly wind speed of 
                        10 miles per hour to qualify for a wind system. The turbine tower's height should be determined by the surrounding wind 
                        obstructions (e.g., buildings or vegetation). Turbine towers are typically 60-140 feet high. <br><br>
