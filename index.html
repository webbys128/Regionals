                        Fossil fuels are the disease that we, as humans, constantly use and continuously harm the earth. 
                        For centuries, humans have relied on fossil fuels for many uses. From cooking, to lighting houses, 
                        and driving cars. Because humanity has constantly used fossil fuels, it is hard to omit and reduce
                        carbon emissions. Fortunately, for the world, green energy has rebounded and started to make a move. 
                        By using green energy, we are helping the earth and making a better place for us all.
                        The difference between Renewable and Green is that not all renewable resources are categorized as green. 
                        Renewable resources such as these can harm our environment and impact it negatively, for example, global warming. <b><b><br><br><br>
